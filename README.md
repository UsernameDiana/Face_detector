# Pattern recognition with machine learning.


Image and pattern recognition can allow computers to translate written text on paper into digital text, 
it can help machine vision, robots and other devices to recognize people and objects or areas.  
Data Mining - The process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information.

### Goal
Our goal is to use machine learning, in the form of pattern recognition, to teach our program how to recognise faces and calculate relation between the pigment indifferences in face and wich faces are recognized faster.  



Is there indifferences (in color?) and if yes, what kind and how big. Possible plotting :)

### Steps we need to do:
1. Getting sample video/images.

2. Once we have sample data, we're going to need the Python programming language and OpenCV. Set up the work enviorement with importing the nececary modules. Work enviorement has to be in the same folder as the sample data/videos.
```Python
import numpy as np
import cv2

etc...
```
3. TODO


### Packages we will use:
* OpenCV - computer vision and machine learning software library.  
* Matplotlib - package for plotting. 
* Numpy - package for mathematical calculations. 
* MeanShift, KMeans for finding colour clusters. 
* TensorFlow - for machine learning.
* Pillow - Python Imaging Library ?
* Thresholding - thresholding any pixel as black if it is any darker or white if it is lighter then average ?
