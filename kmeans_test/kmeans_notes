K-means is a clustering algorithm.

The goal is to partition n data points into k clusters. 
Each of the n data points will be assigned to a cluster with the nearest mean. 
The mean of each cluster is called its “centroid” or “center”.

Data points inside a particular cluster are considered to be “more similar” to each other,
than data points that belong to other clusters.

In our case, we will be clustering the pixel intensities of a RGB image.
We will treat these MxN pixels( containing RED, GREEN, BLUE) as our data points and cluster them using k-means.

To execute script in comand line:

$ python color_kmeans.py --image images/jp.png --clusters 3
