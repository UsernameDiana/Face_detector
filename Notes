Face recognition.

03.05
image segmentation - 
unsupervised learning - no lable on data, finding clusters by color indiferences

1. clone openCV source code - face recognition:
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/python/facedetect.py

10.05
2. which faces are recognized the fastest
pigment differences between recognized faces (plotting, clusters)

17.05
Take a picture of each of us, 
run facedetect
then give the original pictures fixed size of face (200x200),
save resized images
run grayscale histogram on the 3 pictures and find treshold value.

//scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean

Live stream also uses the same size rectangule, for face recognition.
Compute the difference from the live stream video.
Build the sum of the indiferences, when comparing picture and recognised face from video.
